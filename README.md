## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE, provides a more interpretable error value.
- **R-Squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance of the data.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the percentage error between predicted and actual values.
